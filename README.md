# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
We have been assigned to analyze the ride share data  of PyBer a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. We have to analyze the data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize. She is a former programmer who started out at MathWorks, 
a co-founder of PyBer, and is known for being extremely fair yet extremely demanding. Because of her programming expertise, she's particularly insistent that the analytical work be comprehensive and correct. 

## Resources
- Data Source : city_data.csv, ride_data.csv,PyBer_ride_data.csv
- Software    : Python 3.8, Visual studio code, 1.67.2

## Results 
Below are the results of the analysis between the three city types Urban, Suburban and Rural
-Urban
  - Total number of rides are 1,625
  - Total number of drivers are 2,405
  - Total fare amounts to $39,854.38	
  - Average fare per ride is $24.53
  - Average fare per driver is $16.57
- Suburban 
  - Total number of rides are 625
  - Total number of drivers are 490
  - Total fare amounts to $19,356.33		
  - Average fare per ride is $30.97
  - Average fare per driver is $39.50
- Rural 
  - Total number of rides are 125
  - Total number of drivers are 78
  - Total fare amounts to $4,327.93		
  - Average fare per ride is $34.62
  - Average fare per driver is $55.49
Below is the results data shown in a tabular format.

When we look at the line chart of these three city types fares from Jan to may of 2019 we can say that the total amount of fares is higher in Rural areas compared to Urban and suburban. Even suburban city types have the fares amounts more compared to that of the Urban types. 
Below is the image explaining the sum of fares for each city type from January to May of 2019.

## Challenge Summary
When we look at the results for each city type it states that the number of drivers and rides are less in Suburban cities when compared to the Urban cities . The driver and ride numbers decrease very much in Rural areas when compared to the suburban and urban cities. Even when we look at the fares we can say that the total fares, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver is very very higher when we compare it with the fares of Urban and Suburban cities. We can say based on these findings that since the number of rides and drivers are very less in rural and suburban areas compared to that of urban areas the cost per ride and the cost per driver is very much higher.
The recommendations bases on the findings are as follows
- Ensure the cost per ride decreases in Rural and Suburban areas.
- Increase the number of rides in Rural and Suburban areas.
- Increase the number of drivers in Rural and Suburban areas.
